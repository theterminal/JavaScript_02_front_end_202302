You will be given a string representing a username.
The correct password will be that username reversed.
Until you receive the correct password print on the console: "Incorrect password. Try again.‚Äù.
When you receive the correct password print: "User {username} logged in." 
However, on the fourth try if the password is still not correct print: "User {username} blocked!" and end the program. 
The input comes as an array of strings - the first string represents username and each subsequent string is a password.
