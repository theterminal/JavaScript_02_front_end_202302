Problem 11 - Road Radar - judge: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Compete/Index/3786#10


Write a function that determines whether a driver is within the speed limit.
You will receive the speed and the area.
Each area has a different limit: 
On the motorway, the limit is 130 km/h
On the interstate, the limit is 90 km/h
In the city, the limit is 50 km/h 
Within a residential area, the limit is 20 km/h

If the driver is within the limits, there should be a printed speed and the speed limit.
`Driving {speed} km/h in a {speed limit} zone`

If the driver is over the limit, however, your function should print the severity of the infraction and the difference in speeds. 
`The speed is {difference} km/h faster than the allowed speed of {speed limit} - {status}`

For speeding up to 20 km/h over the limit, the status should be speeding.
For speeding up to 40 km/h over the limit, the status should be excessive speeding.
For anything else, status should be reckless driving.

The input comes as 2 string parameters.
The first element is the current speed (number), the second element is the area.
The output should be printed on the console.


Test Data:
---------------------------


Input 1:
-------
40, 'city'


Output 1:
--------
Driving 40 km/h in a 50 zone


---------------------------


Input 2:
-------
21, 'residential'


Output 2:
--------
The speed is 1 km/h faster than the allowed speed of 20 - speeding


---------------------------


Input 3:
-------
120, 'interstate'


Output 3:
--------
The speed is 30 km/h faster than the allowed speed of 90 - excessive speeding


---------------------------


Input 4:
-------
200, 'motorway'


Output 4:
--------
The speed is 70 km/h faster than the allowed speed of 130 - reckless driving
