    The response from the server should be:

        Server started on port 3030. You can make requests to http://localhost:3030/
        Admin panel located at http://localhost:3030/admin

    Leave this window alone like that...

    Enter the command: npm i

    This will install all dependencies from the file package.json and will create more files and folders.

    Enter the command: npm start

    The response from the server will be something like this:

    > http-server -a localhost -p 3000 -P http://localhost:3000? -c-1
    Starting up http-server, serving ./
    Available on:  http://localhost:3000

    Now you can open a browser window and go to the address http://localhost:3000
    That is where the problem data should be entered and received.
